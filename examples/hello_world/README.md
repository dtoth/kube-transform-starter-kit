The Hello World project provides a very simple introduction to kube-transform.

This code identifies all files in a given input folder, processes them in parallel, and then writes the results to an output folder. There is one output file per input file.

In this example, the processing simply consists of appending "Hello World: " to the start of each line in the file.

For instructions on how to run this project, see the root README.
